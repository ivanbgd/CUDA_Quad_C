# CUDA_Quad_C
Calculates a definite integral by using three different rules. Compares sequential to parallel implementations.

Contains three different variants of parallel implementations (v1, v2-1, v2-3) than can be compared to each other.

Output files contain results of running the programs, under Linux environment.

A bash script "run" is also included, though the programs have default values to work with.
